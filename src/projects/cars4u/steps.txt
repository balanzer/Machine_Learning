Objective
come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and can help the business in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing. 
To explore and visualize the dataset, build a linear regression model to predict the prices of used cars, and generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the business.

Data 

S.No.: Serial number
Name: Name of the car which includes brand name and model name
Location: Location in which the car is being sold or is available for purchase (cities)
Year: Manufacturing year of the car
Kilometers_driven: The total kilometers driven in the car by the previous owner(s) in km
Fuel_Type: The type of fuel used by the car (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, CNG, LPG)
Transmission: The type of transmission used by the car (Automatic/Manual)
Owner: Type of ownership
Mileage: The standard mileage offered by the car company in kmpl or km/kg
Engine: The displacement volume of the engine in CC
Power: The maximum power of the engine in bhp
Seats: The number of seats in the car
New_Price: The price of a new car of the same model in INR Lakhs (1 Lakh INR = 100,000 INR)
Price: The price of the used car in INR Lakhs

data preprocessing
  Convert Numbers Categoty to actual number columns (income_to_num)
    convert price 
      can price be normalized using log or min max?
    check all columns for any possible conversions 
    any column conver to date time?
  Feature Engineering
    can any coulumns combined?
    Can any columns split?
    can any new feature columns created like year?
    can any columns running number can be bucket into bins? like height or age 
  Drop unwanted columns 

  Create Dummy variables
  Fix missing values 
  Fix category values which ocurrless google and add appropiate real values
  Outlier Treatment

Conclusion





What all independent variables effect the pricing of used cars?
Does name of a car have any effect on pricing of car.?
 Does kilometers_Driven,Year of manufacturing have negative correlation with price of the car?
- Does Mileage ,Engine and Power have any effect on the pricing of the car?
- How does number of seat ,Fuel type effect the pricing.?


cars[cars.Mileage.isnull()==True]

cars.query("Power == '0.0'")['Power'].count()

cars.loc[cars["Mileage"]=='0.0','Mileage']=np.nan

Power has some values as "nullbhp" .Mileage also has some observations as 0. For fuel type and CNG and LPG mileage is measured in km/kg where as for other type it is measured in kmpl. Since those units are in km for both of them no need of conversion . Dropping units from mileages,Engine and Power.


age of car?

high and low range?




### Observation on Kilometers_Driven 

* it has one extreme outlier showing 6.5 million - we should fix this row 

* 75% cars driven around 70K Kms 

* car is BMW X5 Xdrive 30D M Sport	4, 4 yrs old so lets fix the value has 65K Kms
